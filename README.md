A place to share my meetup talk content

Code for the [Karlsruhe meetup in November
2024](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/karlsruhe-python-meetup/events/304199049/?eventorigin=group_events_list)
can be found in this folder. Have a look at the history for the different steps
I took.

### Description of the talk:
If you are like me, then you love the idea of programming for fun or
recrational programming, but don't often find the time to do it. And if I am in
the mood, it is hard to find a fitting problem to solve that is challenging but
not too big. An answer to this is Advent of Code where every year in December
24 puzzles (or 48, as they always come in two parts) are presented in a little
Christmas flavored story. Usually I like hacking away and getting some results.
After getting the answers right my engineer brain starts to nag about my code:
Can I refactor this to be better? Usually the answer is yes and we can learn
about some Design Patterns along the way! On top of that I will touch some
modern tooling like uv or py-spy.
